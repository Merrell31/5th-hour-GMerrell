#1. Print "Hello World!"
print ("hello world")
#2. import the 'math' library
import math
#3. Create two variables, x and y, that asks the user for a decimal (float) for x and an integer for y.
X = float(input("give me a float"))
Y = int(input("give me an integer"))
#4. Create a variable with the value that is x and y added together.
Z = (X + Y)
#5. Print the variable from #4.
print (Z)
#6. Create a variable with the value that is x and y added together, then divide the sum by 3.
D = (Z/3)
#7. Print the variable from #6.
print (D)
#8. Create a variable with the value of the square root of y, then print the result.
print (math.sqrt(D))
#9. Use the round function to round x to the nearest tenths place (EX: 1.17 rounds to 1.1). Print the result.
print (round(X))
#10. Use the ceiling function to round x up to the nearest whole number. Print the result.
print (math.ceil(X))
# #11. Use the floor function to round x down to the nearest whole number. Print the result.
print (math.floor(X))
